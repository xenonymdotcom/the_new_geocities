# Github is the new geocities

This repo is my public stuff, that years ago would have gone on the now
defunct [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities) (I do assume more ppl reading this had no clue about such things!)

First project that I'm trying to publish will be some retro computing experiments
with [65c816](https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/Western-Design-Center-WDC/W65C816S6PG-14?qs=opBjA1TV900oFHK2UUDZKA%3D%3D) like [this experiment with an 65C816](https://mike42.me/blog/2022-01-a-first-look-at-the-65c816-processor)
